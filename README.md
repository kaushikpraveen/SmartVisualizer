# SmartVisualizer
Usage of smartphone to capture images is a very common occurrence today. However, people with vision problems might not be able to clearly see the pictures. I've developed a Cognitive app which uses Visual Recognition & Text-to-Speech Conversion Capability of IBM Watson which allows both normal person or a person with some eye condition(Blurry vision, Color Blindness, Hypermetropia, etc.) to Understand an object, sign or an unknown language through the speech guidance capability of the app. This app Describes an object recognized through the input image which is sent to the visual-recognition service and the description which is a collection of some keywords is sent back in text form, after it the text is then renderd into audio through text-to-speech service which is accessible & very beneficial to people who cant view the mobile screen properly. This app is a Visual Aid & can have a vast implementation. 

#Note-
*IBM Bluemix Visual recognition Service not binding properly, have to wait for 24 hrs to obtain new key to bind again.. please try again later..Everything else is correct..the app will be redeployed again soon.
